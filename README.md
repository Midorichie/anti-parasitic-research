# Anti-Parasitic Research Funding Platform

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Stacks blockchain for supporting parasitology research projects. The platform enables transparent fund distribution based on predefined milestones and validator approvals.

## Project Overview

This smart contract system facilitates:
- Creation of research funding projects
- Milestone-based fund distribution
- Multi-party validation of research progress
- Transparent tracking of contributions
- SIP-010 token compatibility for funding

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Project Management**
   - Project creation with funding goals
   - Milestone definition and tracking
   - Status management system

2. **Funding Mechanism**
   - SIP-010 compliant token support
   - Individual contribution tracking
   - Automated fund distribution

3. **Validation System**
   - Milestone approval workflow
   - Validator assignment
   - Progress verification

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet installation
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Node.js and npm

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Initialize Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet new
```
4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet test
clarinet console
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Smart contracts in `/contracts`
- Tests in `/tests`
- Documentation in `/docs`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Minimum 50% test coverage

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Validator authentication
   - Fund distribution safeguards

2. **Fund Safety**
   - Escrow mechanism
   - Milestone-based release
   - Multiple approval requirements

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Complex state management
   - Milestone validation logic
   - Token integration complexity

2. **Operational Challenges**
   - Validator coordination
   - Progress verification
   - Fund distribution timing

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Basic project creation
- Funding functionality
- Milestone management

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Enhanced validation system
- Multiple token support
- Advanced reporting

### Phase 3 (Future)
- DAO integration
- Automated milestone verification
- Cross-chain compatibility
